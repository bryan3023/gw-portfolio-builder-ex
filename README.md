# GW Portfolio Builder Exercise

This project is a simple exericise to practices a few of the concepts we've been working on recently:

* Reading input from Node.js via Inquirer.
* Building strings via string templates.
* Writing files via the FS module.

The goal of the project is to ask the user a series of questions, and then build and save a portfolio HTML page based on their responses.

The resulting file isn't pretty, but it meets the requirements.
